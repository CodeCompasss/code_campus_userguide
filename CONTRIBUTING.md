# Contributing to CodeCampus User Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the CodeCampus User Guide! It's people like you that make CodeCampus a great resource for students worldwide.

## 📜 Our Vision

We aim to provide the **best possible documentation** for beginner software engineers. We don't just want to list commands; we want to teach the **"Why"** and the **"How"** of professional development.

## 🛠️ How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
- Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CodeCompasss/code_campus_userguide/issues).
- Describe the bug and, if possible, suggest a fix.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
- If you think a tool or workflow is missing, open an issue to discuss it.

### 3. Adding or Improving Documentation
This is the most impactful way to contribute! However, we have **strict quality standards**. All new tool documentation **MUST** follow the **[Antigravity.md Specification](Antigravity.md)**.

#### Every tool description must include:
1. **What is it?**: Conceptual, beginner-friendly explanation.
2. **Installation**: Proper tabs for Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, and openSUSE.
3. **Why this tool matters (In Depth)**: The most important part—explain the "Why."
4. **How students will actually use it**: Practical, concrete examples.
5. **Professional Insight**: Senior-level tips and pitfalls to avoid.

## 🚀 Style Guide

- **Professional Tone**: Avoid slang and emojis in the documentation body.
- **Direct Language**: Be concise and avoid filler words.
- **Markdown Headers**: Use only `#`, `##`, and `###` appropriately.
- **No Marketing**: We are here to teach, not to sell.

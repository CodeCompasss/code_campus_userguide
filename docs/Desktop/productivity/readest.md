# Readest

### What is it?

Readest is a modern, open-source "read-it-later" application designed to help users manage and consume long-form digital content without distractions. It serves as a personal library where you can save articles, documentation, and blog posts to read in a clean, unified interface that strips away advertisements, tracking scripts, and complex website layouts.

In the software development ecosystem, Readest belongs to the **information management and continuous learning layer**. It provides a dedicated space for deep reading, separate from the fast-paced and often fragmented environment of a web browser or social media feed.

### Installation (Optional)

!!! note
    CodeCampus OS includes Readest by default.
    Use the commands below only if you are installing it on a different Linux distribution.

=== "Flatpak"
    ```bash
    flatpak install flathub com.github.readest.readest
    ```

=== "AppImage"
    1. Download the latest `.AppImage` from the [official repository](https://github.com/readest/readest/releases).
    2. Make the file executable: `chmod +x readest.AppImage`.
    3. Run it: `./readest.AppImage`.

### Why this tool matters (In Depth)

One of the greatest challenges for a modern software engineer is "information overload." The field of technology changes so rapidly that developers must constantly consume new documentation, tutorials, and research papers. However, reading these on their original websites often leads to "click-hole" behavior—where a user starts reading about a library and ends up distracted by unrelated links or sidebars.

Readest matters because it facilitates **deep work**. By capturing high-quality technical content and presenting it in a standardized, book-like format, it allows students to focus entirely on the conceptual material. It turns the browser from a place of consumption into a place of collection, and Readest into a place of processing and learning.

For students, this distinction is vital. Building a habit of saving technical articles for later "focused reading blocks" prevents the shallow learning that occurs when trying to skim documentation while simultaneously wrestling with code. It encourages a more disciplined approach to learning that separate "discovery" from "digestion."

### How students will actually use it

Students will use Readest to streamline their learning workflow and build a personal knowledge library:

*   **Content Curation:** Saving promising technical tutorials or documentation pages found during research for later study.
*   **Focused Reading:** Using the clutter-free "Reader View" to study complex topics like system design or algorithmic theory without visual distractions.
*   **Offline Access:** Syncing and downloading articles to read during commutes or in environments with limited internet connectivity.
*   **Knowledge Organization:** Categorizing saved articles into folders or tags (e.g., "Linux Kernel," "Python Optimization," "Front-end Patterns") for future reference.

### Professional Insight (Top 1% Knowledge)

Experienced engineers treat their reading list not as a "bucket of links" but as a **curated curriculum**. A senior developer knows that not every article found on Hacker News or Dev.to is worth reading immediately. They use tools like Readest to filter for quality, often letting articles "sit" for a few days to see if the topic remains relevant before committing the time to read them.

A professional habit is to use the **highlighting and annotation** features within such tools. Simply reading an article is a passive activity; highlighting key technical insights or documenting how a specific pattern might apply to your current project turns it into active learning. Over years, this practice transforms a simple list of saved links into a high-value, searchable personal knowledge base that can be indexed more effectively than a standard browser history.

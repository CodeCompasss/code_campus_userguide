---

### What is it?

The **GNOME Shell Extension Manager** is a **tool for managing GNOME Shell extensions** on Linux desktops. GNOME Shell extensions are **small add-ons that customize the behavior and appearance of your GNOME desktop**, allowing you to tweak panels, menus, notifications, window behavior, and much more.

The Extension Manager simplifies:

* **Finding and installing new extensions**
* **Enabling or disabling installed extensions**
* **Updating extensions**
* **Removing extensions safely**

Without an extension manager, users would have to manually download, move, and configure extension files, which is **confusing and error-prone** for beginners.

In short, the Extension Manager **lets you enhance your GNOME desktop safely and efficiently**, making your desktop more productive and personalized.

### How to Install

On Ubuntu-based systems like **CodeCampus OS**, installing the Extension Manager is straightforward. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
```

Once installed, you can launch it from the applications menu by searching for **“Extension Manager”**.

**Optional:** Make sure the browser integration is installed if you want to install extensions directly from the web:

```bash
sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell
```

This allows you to use your web browser to browse GNOME extensions and install them directly into GNOME Shell.
